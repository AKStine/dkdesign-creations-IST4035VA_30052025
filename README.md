### Personal portfolio showcasing my web design and branding expertise as part of the IST4035VA course project.

This repository contains the code for a **dynamic, interactive landing page** with sections dedicated to your brand, services, and an engaging **gamified Q&A page**. The project uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a luxury, professional feel with smooth page transitions, a **pulsing button** for navigation, and responsive design.
